# Capstone-Project

## This GitHub repo serves as a codebase for my final year capstone project, which is a web app platform for connecting chefs with customers. 

Frameworks: Django and React

To run server:

'python3 manage.py runserver'

And then the server is running up on the local host: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
